# Question

`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok` -
   This property will display a boolean for whether or not the request was successful.
2. `Response.status` -
   This displays the status code of a response.
3. `Response.url` -
   This property displays the final `Response` URL after any redirects.
4. `Response.headers` -
   This property displays the `Header` object that is related to the response.
